    <h3>
      In this code, we have added a style block within the head section to
      define the CSS styles. Here's a breakdown of the added styles:
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The body element has a background color, margin, and padding to create
        spacing.
      </li>
      <li>The headings h1 and h2 have specific colors and alignment.</li>
      <li>The hr element has a dashed border to create a horizontal line.</li>
      <li>
        The movie information is wrapped in a div container with a background
        color, border, border-radius, and padding to create a card-like
        appearance.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ::before pseudo-element is used to create a small circular shape at
        the top of the movie container using CSS art.
      </li>
      <li>
        The movie titles h3 and descriptions p have specific colors and margins.
      </li>
    </ol>
